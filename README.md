na-euler-methods
================

This is source code is for the course MAT 3633 -- Numerical Analysis offered at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

While quite a bit of the code is more exhaustive than I planned to share, this will help you move along in the course. Most of my effort has gone to streamlining output since the equations are easy
to implement.

This code specifically aims to implement explicit and implicit Euler discrete approximations. The results/output may not be "perfect" (i.e., you won't always get what you expect), but I will use the old cliche in Math books and leave that as an exercise to the reader/student.


Installation
============

Simply run:

make
make install

And you should be ready to go.

Using
=====

The binary executable for this file is euler, so simply run

./euler

and follow the prompts. To check to output, open euler.log to see how effectively you've approximated each DE.
